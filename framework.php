<?php

#framework - provide structure of your application (Framework could have many libraries you can use with it)
#library - is just a tool you could use

//PHP frameworks provides an architecture. that's the difference between PHP frameworks and other language's framework.
//90% of the PHP frameworks enforces MVC architecture.

//there are opinionated and un-opinionated frameworks
//Opinionated enforces specifics how you have to structure your app
//Un-opinionated is flexible, provides lots of options

//Pros for opinionated framework :
//  - enforces consistency
//  - you just need to learn one thing. no decision needs to be made
//  - it's easier to interpret (because you just need to learn one way)
//  - More change that newly joined developer can start working right away

//Cons for opinionated framework :
//  - there's not flexibility (even if something is difficult to do it this way, you must do it this way)
//  - generally learning curve is steeper
//  - generally the size is bigger (more files, longer codes) - potentially it could make it slower but not necessarily.

//Pros for Un-opinionated framework :
//  - light weight (smaller, faster), flexible (different ways to solve problems)
//  - it's harder to enforce consistency
//  - more room for discussion could mean slow down the dev process
//  - the chance is slimmer to find a developer who does the way that's exactly the way we do it
